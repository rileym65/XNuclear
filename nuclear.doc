Welcome to Nukeplant for X

This is really only a pre-release, so do not expect too much!

This document will explain how to start up and control this nuclear power plant.

Compilation:
This package requires libRcs (separate package) to compile.  There is nothing
out of the ordinary with the code, so it should compile on just about anything.


When you start the program, the plant will be in a state of Cold-Shutdown.  Your
first task will be to bring the plant up to Hot-Standby.  Follow these steps:

1. Start the Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCP1,RCP2,RCP3), The pumps are in operation
   When the light next to the buttons appears green.

2. Using the Feed Valves (FV1,FV2,FV3) adjust the Steam Generator (SG1,SG2,SG3)
   levels so that the needles are in the White area.  You will need to turn off
   the feed valves when the levels are correct.

3. Turn off the Auxilliary Feed Pumps (AFP1,AFP2).  The pumps are turned off 
   when the indicator light shows red.

4. Reset the reactor (Rx).  The reactor is in operation when the indicator light
   shows green.

5. Move the rods out until the primary and secondary temperature and pressure
   warning lights turn off.

At this point the plant is in Hot-Standby, The only warning indicators should be
Turbine Trip and possibly Steam-Feed Mismatch.

Follow these steps to place you plant onto the power grid:

1. Reset the turbine.  The turbine is in operation when the indicator light
   shows green.

2. Adjust the throttle until the RPM's are indicated in the white zone of the
   meter.  The Sync light should also be lit.

3. Press the Grid button to attach the plant to the power grid.  When the 
   indicator light is green, the plant is on-line.

You are now ready to start supplying your customers with power.  To do this 
all you need to do is increase the Load control.  You should increase the
load slowly, and make adjustments as needed as you start increasing your
output power.  When you increase the load, you will need to increase the
feed valves for the steam generators, and you will also need to move the
control rods out.  Try to increase the plant to 100% output power, and keep all
warning lights off. good luck!

The controls:

RCP 1	- Turns on/off Reactor Coolant Pump #1
RCP 2	- Turns on/off Reactor Coolant Pump #2
RCP 3	- Turns on/off Reactor Coolant Pump #3

Out	- Move the control rods out (continuous)
Out 1	- Move the control rods out one position
In 1	- Move the control rods in one position
In	- Move the control rods in (continuous)

Rx	- Start or stop the Reactor
SI	- Start safety injection.  This increases mass if there is a leak in
	  the primary loop.  Keep an eye on the Pri-Mass % meter when using 
          this control
SI%	- This slider controls the amount of Safety Injection
Pri PORV- Primary Relief Valve. This is used in order to release excess pressure
	  in the primary loop.

FV1	- Feed Valve 1.  This valve controls the water to Steam Generator 1
FV2	- Feed Valve 2.  This valve controls the water to Steam Generator 2
FV3	- Feed Valve 3.  This valve controls the water to Steam Generator 3

FP 1	- Feed Pump 1. Feed pump for the Steam Generators
FP 2	- Feed Pump 2. Feed pump for the Steam Generators
AFP1	- Auxilliary Feed Pump 1
AFP2	- Auxilliary Feed Pump 2
Stm Dmp	- Steam Dump.  This is used in order to quickly release steam from the
 	  Steam Generators.  This is used generally when the Turbine trips.
S.Dump	- This controls the amount of steam released when the Stm Dmp control
	  is activated
Sec PORV- Secondary Relief Valve. This is used in order to release excess pressure
	  in the secondary loop.

Turbine	- This starts or stops the Turbine
Grid	- This attaches or removes the plant from the power grid
Load	- This controls the amount of power your plant is outputting
Voltage	- This controls the voltage output from your plant
RPM	- This controls the RPMs of the Turbine.  RPMs must be adjusted so
	  that the Sync light is lit.  If the plant is out of sync, the
	  turbine will be tripped when you attempt to attach to the power grid


Helpful tips:

Before increasing output power, move the rods so that the temperature and 
pressures appear near the top of the safe zone.  Also adjust the S/G levels
to near the top of their safe zones.

Before decreasing output power, move the rods so that the temperature and
pressures appear near the bottom of the safe zone.  Also adjust the S/G levels
to near the bottom of their safe zones.

Keep a close eye on the S/G levels, this is where most of your problems 
causing reactor trips will occur.


Note: This program is not really finished.  The plant itself is 100% operational,
but there is not much game to it, other than keeping it running.  Future
enhancements include:
	Scoring system
	Random problems
	Random loads
	Multi-plant operation
